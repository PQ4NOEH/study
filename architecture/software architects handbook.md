# Chapter I
 ## Software architecture
Software architecture is an abstraction of a software system. among the miriads of concrete definitions :
  - ISO y IEEE "Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principle of its design and evolution." the key points are:
  - Software architecture in practice "The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them."
 
**SA concerns itself with defining and detailing structures and their relationships. It focus on the public aspect of the elements and how they interact with other. It does not deal with the private implementation details of those elements.**
Consists of important decisions that shape the system. It is made up of the structures and components that are significant to the quality, longevity, and usefulness of the system.
