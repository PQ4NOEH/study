# Chapter I
 ## Software architecture
Software architecture is an abstraction of a software system. among the miriads of concrete definitions :
  - ISO y IEEE "Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principle of its design and evolution." the key points are:
  - Software architecture in practice "The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software elements, the externally visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them."
 
**SA concerns itself with defining and detailing structures and their relationships. It focus on the public aspect of the elements and how they interact with other. It does not deal with the private implementation details of those elements.**
Consists of important decisions that shape the system. It is made up of the structures and components that are significant to the quality, longevity, and usefulness of the system.

# Chapter II

## Types of software architects
1. Enterprise architect
2. Solution architect
3. Application architect
4. Data architect / Information architect
5. Security architect
6. Cloud architect
## Software development methodologies

### The waterfall model
Consist on a series of secuential steps which are accomplished one after another for example
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Verification
5. Maintenance

### Agile
There are a variety of models: Scrum, kanban, XP, Crystal. Each has it's particularity but all of them focus on being adaptable to change and the attempt to find a balance betweennot having enought processes and having too much of them.

Agile Manifesto core values states (4 core principles of agile software)[https://agilemanifesto.org/]
1. individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over documentation
3. Customer interaction and continous engagement over contract negotiation
4. Adaptation over following a plan



## Project management
### project schedule changes management
In order to get a project back on schedule there are a number of approaches:
1. working overtime
2. Reducing scope
3. Adding resources
4. Reallocatin resources

## Office politics
## Software risk management
Document potential risks. Different categories of risk:
1. Functional. Incorrect requirements, lack of participation, confliting business goals
2. Technical. Complexity, unknown technology, vendor or subcontractors dependencies.
3. Personnel. unexperienced team members, unable to staff the project, productivity issues with team members.
4. Financial. insufficient funding, difficult ROI constraint.
5. Legal.
6. Management. unexperienced, incorrect planning, lack of communication, organizational issues.

for every project make (a risk impact likelihood)[https://www.slideteam.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/543x403/0e7a751fc24f39b632cb88e6c5925d9b/p/r/priority_ranking_action_matrix_sample_of_ppt_Slide01.jpg]
