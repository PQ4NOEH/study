+ Rest-ful routing:
  - Verbs
    + create = POST.
    + Get = fetch.
    + Put = Update overall resource.
    + Patch = Update a specific part of the resource.
    + DELETE = delete the resource.
  + routing
    - /[resource-name]
    - /[resource-name]/:id
    - /[resource-name]/:id/[resource-name]
    - /[resource-name]/:id/[resource-name]/:id (weird!!) ![alt text](https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/99960-200.png)
## Why it exists?
Walk a resource graph ina rest-ful manner might be very challenging when the graph becames nested
## What it is?
## How do we use it?
